# Using-Random-Forest-Regression-to-build-a-portfolio-of-stocks-based-on-Modern-Portfolio-Theory


This is one of my courseworks submitted to complete my MSc in Data Science at City, University of London.

The aim of this research is to form a portfolio of 5 stocks (out of 500 S&P stocks) and compare the
return of this portfolio against the S&P index return.
In the process of achieving this aim, the following questions will be addressed:
A. Which sectors and individual stocks provide greatest return?
A.1. Which are the top 5 sectors providing greatest return?
A.2. Which are the top 5 stocks within each sector that provide the greatest return?
A.3. Which are the top 5 stocks that provide the greatest return overall
B. What is the correlation between the stocks and the sectors?
B.1. What is the correlation between stocks of each sector?
B.2. Which stocks are correlated across the sectors?
B.3. Which sectors are correlated with each other?
B.4. What is the correlation between the 5 selected stocks?
C. Compare cumulative return of selected portfolio against that of S&P index.
